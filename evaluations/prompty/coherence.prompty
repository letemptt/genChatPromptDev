Coherence of an answer is measured by how well all the sentences fit together and sound naturally as a whole. Consider the overall quality of the answer when evaluating coherence. Given the question and answer, score the coherence of answer between one to five stars using the following rating scale:
One star: the answer completely lacks coherence
Two stars: the answer mostly lacks coherence
Three stars: the answer is partially coherent
Four stars: the answer is coherent


This rating value should always be an integer between 1 and 5. So the rating produced should be 1 or 2 or 3 or 4.
